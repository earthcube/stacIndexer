Use `arrow` for remote access to the database. This will return all scored forecasts for the NEON Ecological Forecasting Aquatics theme.

### R

```{r}
# Copy URL from "URL for Amazon S3" button above and save as object named "url_for_s3" 
# Use in code below

all_scores <- arrow::open_dataset(url_for_s3)
df <- all_scores |> dplyr::collect()

```

Now use dplyr operations to summarise or subset (if necessary), followed by `dplyr::collect()` to bring this data into R as a `data.frame`.
