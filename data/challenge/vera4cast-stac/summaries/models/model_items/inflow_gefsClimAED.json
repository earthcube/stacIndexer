Temperature is forecasted using a linear relationship between historical water temperature, month, and 5-day mean air temperature.  NOAA GEFS is then used to get the future values of 5-day sum precipitation and mean temperature.  Nutrients are forecasting using the DOY climatology.  The DOY climatology was developed using a linear interpolation of the historical samples.\n\nSites: tubr\n\nVariables: Daily Dissolved methane, Daily Dissolved organic carbon concentration, Daily dissolved organic carbon concentration, Daily Dissolved silica concentration, Daily Inflow discharge, Daily ammonium concentration, Daily Nitrate concentration, Daily Total soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, Daily Total nitrogen concentration, Daily Total phosphorus concentration, Daily Water_temperature",
