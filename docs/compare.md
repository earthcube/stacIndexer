#### STAC vs. FAIR Digital Objects

| Feature                 | STAC                               | FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Standardizes metadata for Earth observation assets | Enhances discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of digital objects |
| **Focus**                | Earth observation data (imagery, radar, LiDAR, etc.) | Broad range of digital objects (scientific data, code, workflows, etc.) |
| **Schema**               | JSON-based schema                  | Flexible schema (can be domain-specific) |
| **Properties**           | Extensive properties for Earth observation data | Core properties focus on identification, access, reuse |
| **Extensions**           | Supports extensions for specific domains | Can be extended through profiles |
| **Community**            | Earth science community            | Broad scientific community   |
